      **Summary:** The percentage of failed function executions has exceeded 2% over
      the last 10 minutes.
      **Impact:** A portion of function invocations are failing, which could impact
      application logic and user experience.

# Cloud Functions Performance: High Execution Time
- display_name: "Cloud Functions: High Execution Time (Warning)"
  enabled: true
  combiner: "OR"
  documentation:
    content: |
      **Summary:** The P99 execution time is approaching the function's timeout
      limit.
      **Impact:** Increased risk of function timeouts, which are treated as errors
      and can cause unexpected application behavior.
      **NOTE:** The threshold (e.g., 45s) MUST be adjusted based on the specific
      function's configured timeout (e.g., 60s). This policy should be duplicated
      for functions with different timeouts.

# Cloud Functions Saturation: High Memory Usage

  documentation:

      **Summary:** The P99 memory usage is approaching the function's configured
      memory limit.
      **Impact:** High risk of out-of-memory errors, which cause the function to
      fail and restart.
      **NOTE:** The threshold (e.g., 460MB for a 512MB function) MUST be adjusted
      based on the specific function's configured memory.
