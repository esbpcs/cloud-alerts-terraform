# App Engine Health: High Server Error (5xx) Rate
- display_name: "App Engine: High Server Error Rate (Critical)"

  documentation:
    content: |
      **Summary:** The rate of 5xx server-side errors has exceeded 1% of requests over the last 10 minutes.
      **Impact:** A significant portion of user requests are failing due to application-level errors (e.g., crashes, exceptions). The service is unhealthy.

      **Summary:** There have been zero running instances detected for an App Engine service for over 5 minutes.
      **Impact:** The service is likely down and unable to serve any traffic, resulting in a complete outage for that service. This is expected if a service is intentionally scaled to zero.
