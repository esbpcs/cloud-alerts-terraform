      **Summary:** A Cloud SQL instance is not reporting as 'up'.
      **Impact:** The database is down and completely unavailable. All client
      applications connecting to this instance will fail.

      **Summary:** The CPU utilization for a Cloud SQL instance has exceeded 80%
      for over 15 minutes.
      **Impact:** Query performance is likely degrading. The instance may be
      struggling to keep up with the current load.

      **Summary:** The memory utilization for a Cloud SQL instance has exceeded
      95% for over 10 minutes.
      **Impact:** The instance is at high risk of crashing due to out-of-memory
      errors. Performance is severely degraded as the database may be unable to
      cache effectively.

  documentation:
    content: |
      **Summary:** The disk utilization for a Cloud SQL instance has exceeded 80%.
      **Impact:** The instance is approaching its storage limit. If it runs out of
      space, writes will fail, and the database may become read-only.
