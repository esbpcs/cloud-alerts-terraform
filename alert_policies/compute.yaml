# GCE Availability: Instance Down
- display_name: "GCE: Instance Down (Critical)"

  documentation:
    content: |
      **Summary:** A VM instance has stopped sending uptime data for over 10 minutes.
      **Impact:** The instance is considered down, crashed, or has lost network connectivity. It is not serving traffic.
      **Immediate Checks:**
      1. Check GCP console for instance status and any ongoing zonal/regional issues.
      2. Attempt to SSH into the instance.
      3. Review instance serial console output for boot/crash messages.

# GCE Saturation: High CPU Utilization
- display_name: "GCE: High CPU Utilization (Warning)"
  enabled: true
  combiner: "OR"
  documentation:
    content: |
      **Summary:** The CPU utilization for a VM instance has exceeded 80% for over 15 minutes.
      **Impact:** The instance is under heavy load and may be slow to respond. Performance for users/applications may be degraded.
      **Investigation Steps:**
      1. Identify top processes consuming CPU on the instance (e.g., using `top`, `htop`).
      2. Check application logs for errors or unusual activity.
      3. Review recent code deployments or configuration changes.
      4. Consider if the instance requires vertical scaling (larger machine type) or horizontal scaling (more instances).

# GCE Saturation: High Memory Utilization (Requires Ops Agent)
- display_name: "GCE: High Memory Utilization (Critical)"
  enabled: true
  combiner: "OR"
  documentation:
    content: |
      **Summary:** The memory utilization on a VM instance has exceeded 95% for over 10 minutes.
      **Impact:** The instance is at high risk of OOM (Out Of Memory) errors, which can cause processes to crash or the entire VM to become unresponsive.
      **NOTE:** This alert requires the Google Cloud Ops Agent to be installed on the VM.
      **Investigation Steps:**
      1. Identify top memory-consuming processes (e.g., `top`, `ps aux --sort=-%mem`).
      2. Check for memory leaks in applications.
      3. Review application logs for memory-related errors.
      4. Consider if the instance requires vertical scaling or memory optimization.

      **Summary:** A disk partition on a VM instance is over 80% full.
      **Impact:** The instance may soon run out of disk space, which can cause applications to fail, logs to stop writing, or the OS to become unstable.
      **NOTE:** This alert requires the Google Cloud Ops Agent to be installed on the VM.

# GCE Network: High Received Bytes (Warning)
- display_name: "GCE: High Network Received Bytes (Warning)"
  enabled: true
  combiner: "OR"
  documentation:
    content: |
      **Summary:** A VM instance is receiving an unusually high rate of network
      traffic (e.g., > 100 MB/s for over 5 minutes).
      **Impact:** This could indicate an overloaded instance, a misconfiguration,
      or potentially unwanted traffic (e.g., DDoS attempt). The threshold
      (100 MB/s) is an EXAMPLE and should be adjusted based on expected workload.
      **Playbook:**
      1. Identify the source of the traffic using network flow logs or instance-level tools (iftop, nethogs).
      2. Determine if the traffic is legitimate or malicious.
      3. If legitimate, consider scaling up the instance or optimizing the application.
      4. If malicious, apply firewall rules or Cloud Armor policies.
