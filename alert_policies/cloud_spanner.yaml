# Spanner Saturation: High CPU Utilization (REGIONAL INSTANCES)
- display_name: "Spanner: High CPU Utilization - REGIONAL (Warning)"
  enabled: true

  documentation:
    content: |
      **Summary:** The total CPU utilization for a REGIONAL Spanner instance has
      exceeded 65% for over 15 minutes.
      **Impact:** This is the recommended threshold to begin scaling up. Read and
      write latencies may increase if the load continues to rise.
