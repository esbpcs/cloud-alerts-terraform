# Cloud NAT Availability: Allocation Failures
- display_name: "Cloud NAT: Allocation Failed (Critical)"
  enabled: true
  combiner: "OR"
  documentation:
    content: |
      **Summary:** The Cloud NAT gateway is unable to allocate NAT IP addresses and
      ports for new outbound connections.
      **Impact:** New outbound connections from resources using this NAT will fail.
      This can happen if the NAT runs out of available ports.

# Cloud NAT Utilization: High Port Usage

  enabled: true

  documentation:
    content: |
      **Summary:** The port usage for a NAT gateway has exceeded 80%.
      **Impact:** The gateway is approaching its limit for concurrent connections.
      If usage continues to rise, it will lead to allocation failures.

# Cloud NAT Errors: Dropped Packets

  enabled: true

  documentation:
    content: |
      **Summary:** Outbound packets are being dropped by the NAT gateway due to a
      lack of resources.
      **Impact:** This is an active confirmation of connection failures. It
      directly corresponds to the `nat_allocation_failed` metric.
