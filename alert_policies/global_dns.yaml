# Cloud DNS Health: Server Failure (SERVFAIL) Errors
- display_name: "Cloud DNS: Server Failure (SERVFAIL) Rate (Critical)"
  enabled: true
  documentation:
    content: |
      **Summary:** A Cloud DNS zone is responding to queries with SERVFAIL errors.
      **Impact:** Clients are unable to resolve DNS records in this zone, which can
      lead to service outages. This may indicate a misconfiguration in the zone
      file or an issue with the Cloud DNS service.

# Cloud DNS Performance: High Resolution Latency
- display_name: "Cloud DNS: High P99 Resolution Latency (Warning)"
  enabled: true
  documentation:
    content: |
      **Summary:** The 99th percentile for DNS resolution latency has exceeded 100ms.
      **Impact:** Applications and users are experiencing delays when looking up
      records in this zone. This adds latency to the initial connection time for
      all dependent services.

# Cloud DNS Health: High Non-Existent Domain (NXDOMAIN) Rate
- display_name: "Cloud DNS: High NXDOMAIN Rate (Warning)"
  enabled: true
  documentation:
    content: |
      **Summary:** There is a high rate of queries for records that do not exist
      (NXDOMAIN).
      **Impact:** This is not necessarily an error but can indicate a
      misconfiguration in an application, a deployment issue, or a potential
      reconnaissance/DDoS attempt using random subdomains. Warrants investigation.
