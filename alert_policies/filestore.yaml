# Filestore Saturation: Low Disk Space

      **Summary:** The disk space utilization for a Filestore instance has exceeded 80%.
      **Impact:** The instance is approaching its storage capacity. If it runs out
      of space, write operations will fail.

# Filestore Saturation: Low Inode Count
# Note: The metric 'file.googleapis.com/nfs/server/used_inodes_percent' may not exist for all Filestore tiers.
- display_name: "Filestore: Low Inode Count (Warning)"
  enabled: true
  combiner: "OR"
  documentation:
    content: |
      **Summary:** The inode utilization for a Filestore instance has exceeded 85%.
      **Impact:** The instance is approaching its inode limit. If it runs out of
      inodes, no new files can be created, regardless of available disk space.
      This is common with workloads that use many small files.
