# Cloud Run Jobs: Job Execution Failure (Critical)

      **Summary:** A Cloud Run Job execution has failed.
      **Impact:** The intended task (e.g., data processing, report generation) did
      not complete successfully. Downstream dependencies may be affected.

# Cloud Run Jobs: Performance - Long Execution Time
- display_name: "Cloud Run Job: Long Execution Time (Warning)"
  enabled: true
  combiner: "OR"
  documentation:
    content: |
      **Summary:** The P95 execution time for a job is longer than expected.
      **Impact:** The job is taking more time and resources than planned,
      potentially increasing costs or delaying downstream processes.
      **NOTE:** The threshold (e.g., 30m) is a placeholder and MUST be adjusted
      based on the specific job's expected runtime.

# Cloud Run Jobs: Saturation - High Memory Utilization
- display_name: "Cloud Run Job: High Memory Utilization (Warning)"
  enabled: true
  combiner: "OR"
  documentation:
    content: |
      **Summary:** The P95 memory utilization for a job's containers is very high.
      **Impact:** The job may be at risk of failing with out-of-memory errors. It
      could be a sign of inefficient code or under-provisioned resources.

      **Summary:** The P95 CPU utilization for a job's containers is very high.
