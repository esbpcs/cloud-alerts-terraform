# Pub/Sub Health: High Unacknowledged Messages (Backlog)
- display_name: "Pub/Sub: High Unacknowledged Messages (Warning)"
  enabled: true
  documentation:
    content: |
      **Summary:** The number of unacknowledged messages (the backlog) for a
      subscription has exceeded 1,000 for over 15 minutes.
      **Impact:** Message processing is delayed. This may be caused by slow,
      crashing, or under-scaled subscriber applications.

      **Summary:** The number of unacknowledged messages (the backlog) for a
      subscription has exceeded 10,000 for over 10 minutes.
      **Impact:** Message processing is severely delayed, and there is a high risk
      of messages expiring before they can be processed.

# Pub/Sub Health: Oldest Unacknowledged Message

  enabled: true
  documentation:
    content: |
      **Summary:** The oldest unacknowledged message in a subscription has not
      been processed for over 30 minutes.
      **Impact:** Message processing may have stalled completely for this
      subscription. This is a strong indicator that the subscriber application is
      down or has stopped pulling messages.

# Pub/Sub Health: Dead-Lettered Messages
- display_name: "Pub/Sub: Messages Sent to Dead-Letter Topic (Critical)"
  enabled: true
  documentation:
    content: |
      **Summary:** Messages are being sent to a subscription's dead-letter topic
      (DLQ).
      **Impact:** The subscriber application is explicitly failing to process
      these messages, and they are being sidelined for manual inspection. This
      indicates persistent errors in message processing logic.
